Create a simple "LibraryBook" program that uses access specifiers to manage data. Your program should demonstrate the use of public, private, and protected access specifiers.



The program should consist of the following two classes: 



1.LibraryBook Class: This class should contain the following fields and methods:

  	a. bookTitle: A private field of type String.

  	b. bookAuthor: A private field of type String.

  	c. publishYear: A private field of type int.

  	d. isAvailable: A private field of type boolean.

  	e. LibraryBook(): A public constructor that accepts the book title, author, and publishing year.

  	f. getBookTitle(): A public method that returns the book title.

  	g. getBookAuthor(): A public method that returns the book author.

  	h. getPublishYear(): A public method that returns the book's publishing year.

  	i. checkAvailability(): A public method that returns the book's availability status.

  	j. borrowBook(): A public method that changes the book's availability status to false.

  	k. returnBook(): A public method that changes the book's availability status to true.



2.Main Class: In your main method, create a few instances of the LibraryBook class and demonstrate the borrowing and returning of books.



Your task is to complete the following files:



./src/main/java/LibraryBook.java
./src/main/java/LibraryBookApplication.java


Sample Input and Output:



Book 1 Title: The Great Gatsby

Book 1 Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

Book 1 Publish year: 1925

Book 1 availability: true

Book 1 availability: false

Book 1 availability: true
