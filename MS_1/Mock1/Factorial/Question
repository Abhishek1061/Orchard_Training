You are tasked with creating a console-based Java application that serves as a Factorial Calculator. 



The application should provide a text-based menu with the following options:





Choice 1 - Calculate Factorial: Given an integer n, calculate the factorial of n. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Choice 2 - Factorial Sequence: Given an integer n, print the factorial of every number from 1 to n.
Choice 3 - Factorial Sum: Given an integer n, calculate the sum of the factorials of all numbers from 1 to n.
Choice 4 - Factorial Division: Given two integers m and n, calculate the result of m! / n! (division of m factorial by n factorial).
Choice 5 - Exit: The user should be able to exit the application.


The main method should display the menu to the user with the above options, and depending on the user's choice, call the respective functionality.



Console Interaction:



At startup, the program should print the menu of operations. After each operation, the menu should be displayed again, giving the user the ability to choose the next operation or exit.



If the user selects an option from 1 to 4, prompt the user to enter the necessary data and display the result. If the user selects option 5, print the message "Goodbye!" and exit the application. 



If the user selects a choice other than the five choices given then provide the message "Invalid choice. Please select a valid option." to the user. Ensure that any input errors are handled gracefully with appropriate feedback to the user.
